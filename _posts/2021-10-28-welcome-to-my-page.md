Thank you so much for visiting my page. 

Whether you are here for my blog, my circus performances, or you are a potential employer you are more than welcome. All of the links on the 
footer of this page and on the task bar to your left are links to my professional accounts. 

All of my accounts relate to my legal life aside from my Instagram which promotes my circus
life. 

All of the code for this site is free to use, copy, and modify. If you have questions regarding the licensing please navigate to https://iplavegas.com/license.
